program C = client
program S = server

client-server model

client starts communication. Sends a request. The server returns a response message.
Different clients can communicate with the server at the same time.
If no clients exist, there's no problem.
But if there is no server, there are problems and errors.


These programs are running inside a computer (general term, can be phones,etc...). There can be more than one C and S in each computer,
but the communication model is the same.
They can be in the same computer
They communicate through internet


Internet is composed of networks (groups of isolated computers)

Network interface: the connections made by different computers
IP address: refers to the NI, that changes when you change the computer you're using

10.0.46.22 IP mobile uni
Ip computer 212.128.253.81
Teacher's IP 212.128.253.64


"ping": command that asks if the server is alive, working

ping time to 8.8.8.8 : 3.47 ms
ping time to my computer (212.128.253.81) : 0.058 ms
ping time to edu (212.128.253.82) : 0.579 ms
ping tim e for my mobile (10.0.46.22) : 487 ms

URL: used to identify a computer interface for humans
DNS servers: servers that "translate" the URL into an IP address

IP of www.google.com : 216.58.214.164

PORT (puerto): number that identifies any of the apps that can communicate
WEB servers usually are on port 80

You write the IP nmberr you want and then the port number in order to connect to an specific app
